      <h2>Career Review: Nicolas Cage's Journey Through Hollywood</h2>
      <p>Nicolas Cage's career has been a rollercoaster ride through the realms of cinema, marked by periods of critical acclaim, box office success, and occasional missteps. From his early days in the 1980s to his recent resurgence in the 2020s, Cage's versatility and willingness to take on diverse roles have made him a captivating figure in the film industry.</p>
      <p>In the early 1980s, Cage embarked on his acting journey with small roles in television and film, gradually making a name for himself with standout performances in cult classics like "Valley Girl" and "Rumble Fish." Despite initial setbacks, including losing out on roles to his uncle Francis Ford Coppola's projects, Cage persevered and began to gain recognition for his intense portrayals and commitment to his characters.</p>
      <p>His breakout came in the late 1980s and early 1990s with a string of memorable performances in films like "Moonstruck," for which he earned a Golden Globe nomination, and "Leaving Las Vegas," which earned him an Academy Award for Best Actor. Cage's ability to seamlessly transition between genres—from romantic comedies to action thrillers—solidified his status as a versatile leading man.</p>
      <p>The mid-1990s saw Cage embrace the action genre, starring in blockbuster hits like "The Rock" and "Con Air." While these films showcased his charisma and on-screen presence, they also marked a shift towards more commercially driven projects. Despite some critical acclaim, Cage's choices during this period were met with mixed reviews, with films like "The Wicker Man" drawing particular scrutiny.
      However, Cage's career took an unexpected turn in the late 2000s and early 2010s with a series of eccentric and daring performances in films like "Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans" and "Mandy." Embracing his penchant for the unconventional, Cage delivered performances that were as captivating as they were polarizing, earning praise from critics and audiences alike.</p>
