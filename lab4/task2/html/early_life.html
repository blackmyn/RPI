      <h2>Early Life & Family</h2>
      <p>Cage was born in Long Beach, California, to August Coppola, a professor of literature, and Joy Vogelsang, a dancer and choreographer. He was raised in a Catholic family. His father, August, hailed from Italian roots, while his mother, Joy, had predominantly German and Polish ancestry, with a sprinkle of English and Scottish lineage from her father's side. His family tree boasted notable figures; his paternal grandparents were none other than composer Carmine Coppola and actress Italia Pennino. Delving deeper, Cage's paternal great-grandparents were immigrants from Bernalda, Basilicata.</p>
      <p>His family ties extended to the cinematic world. Through his father, he was a nephew of both acclaimed director Francis Ford Coppola and the talented actress Talia Shire. Moreover, Cage found himself among a constellation of cousins involved in the film industry, including directors Roman Coppola and Sofia Coppola, film producer Gian-Carlo Coppola, and actors Robert and Jason Schwartzman.</p>
      <p>Cage emerged as the youngest of three sons, with his brothers being New York radio personality Marc "The Cope" Coppola and director Christopher Coppola. Despite the illustrious family background, Cage was determined to carve his own path. He pursued his education at Beverly Hills High School, renowned for nurturing numerous entertainment luminaries. His passion for acting ignited early, prompting him to enroll at UCLA School of Theater, Film, and Television. His theatrical debut outside the cinema realm occurred in a school rendition of Golden Boy, marking the beginning of his journey into the performing arts.</p>    
      <p>From a tender age, Cage harbored aspirations to emulate his idol, James Dean. He found profound inspiration in Dean's performances, particularly in Rebel Without a Cause and East of Eden, which left an indelible mark on his psyche. Recalling his fervor for acting, Cage reminisced, "That's what I want to do." </p> 
      <p>At just 15, Cage's determination manifested in a bold move when he approached his uncle, Francis Ford Coppola, demanding a screen test, vowing to showcase his acting prowess. However, his impassioned plea was met with an eerie silence, a poignant reminder of the formidable talent that already graced his uncle's films, including Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Gene Hackman, and Robert De Niro. Despite early appearances in his uncle's projects, Cage adopted the stage name Nicolas Cage, drawing inspiration from the Marvel Comics superhero Luke Cage and the avant-garde composer John Cage, aiming to carve his own distinct identity in the realm of cinema.</p>
